Creating An Alias For Your Gmail Account

Objectives: 	To set-up an alias for your Gmail Account
To forward your notification email from Basecamp to your alias

Purpose: 	To easily filter your work emails from your personal emails


I. How to Create an Alias

•	Add a suffix to the main part of your email address. The way this works is you add ‘+alias’ to the main part of your email address. 

Example: The main part of my email address is admin@gmail.com
To create an alias, I will add “+basecamp” to the main part of my email address. Thus, my alias account is admin+basecamp@gmail.com

Any emails sent to this Alias will show up in the main inbox of your original email address. 


II. How to Change Your Basecamp Setting Email Notification 

•	Log-In to Basecamp.
•	Choose your Basecamp Account (new_os, secual, ancar, etc).
•	Go to ME tab then click Your Basecamp Settings.

 



•	Under the “Your email address”, click Change, input your Alias email, then save the changes.

 

•	Repeat the process to your other basecamp accounts.

Now you have successfully created an Alias email and changed the email notifications from basecamp to your Alias email.

When you log-in to your Gmail account, you can easily filter all basecamp notifications from your other emails. You can do this by typing your Alias in the Search window of your Gmail account, press enter, and your email list is now filtered.
